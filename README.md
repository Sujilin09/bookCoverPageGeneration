##  Getting Started

### Option 1: Use Pre-trained Model (Fastest)

Perfect for immediate use with our pre-trained model:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-book-cover-generator.git
cd ai-book-cover-generator/gradio_app/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Open in browser**: http://localhost:7860

### Option 2: Train Your Own Model (Recommended)

For custom datasets and specialized book genres:

1. **Dataset Collection**: Open `training/dataset_scraping.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. **Model Training**: Open `training/bookCoverGen_Model.ipynb` in Google Colab  
3. **Deploy Application**: Use trained model with the Gradio app

---

##  Training Pipeline

### Dataset Scraping (`dataset_scraping.ipynb`)

**Automated OpenLibrary Integration**
- Searches OpenLibrary API for high-quality book covers
- Downloads 200-500 diverse images across multiple genres
- Generates descriptive captions for each cover
- Filters by quality (minimum 400x600 resolution)
- Creates training-ready dataset structure

**Output**: `lora_dataset.zip` with images and captions folders

### Model Fine-tuning (`bookCoverGen_Model.ipynb`)

**DreamBooth Training Process**
- **Base Model**: Stable Diffusion v1.5 (`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`)
- **Fine-tuning Target**: UNet diffusion model (text encoder and VAE remain frozen)
- **Trigger Words**: "sks book cover" for concept association
- **Training Steps**: 800-1200 with loss monitoring
- **Prior Preservation**: Maintains general book cover knowledge

**Key Features**:
- Selective parameter training (UNet only)
- Memory optimization with gradient checkpointing
- Mixed precision training (fp16) for efficiency
- Regularization with class images to prevent overfitting

**Hardware Requirements**:
- Google Colab Pro recommended
- Minimum 12GB GPU VRAM
- Training time: 2-4 hours

##  Gradio Application

### Features

**Core Functionality**
- **Custom AI Model**: DreamBooth-trained specifically for book covers
- **Professional Text Overlay**: Automatic title, author, and subtitle placement
- **Multi-Genre Support**: Fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, romance, horror, and more
- **Real-time Generation**: 10-30 seconds per cover
- **High Quality Output**: 512x768 standard book cover resolution

### How to Use

1. **Enter Book Details**:
   - Title (required)

##  Best Practices

### For Training

- **Dataset Quality**: Use 300-500 high-quality, diverse book covers
- **Caption Accuracy**: Write detailed, genre-specific descriptions
- **Training Monitoring**: Watch loss curves and generate test images
- **Resource Management**: Use Colab Pro for stable GPU access

### For Generation

- **Prompt Engineering**: Be specific about genre, mood, and visual elements
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust inference steps and guidance scale per genre
- **Multiple Attempts**: Generate several options for best results
- **Text Overlay**: Use built-in text features for professional finishing

##  Troubleshooting

### Training Issues

**Out of Memory**: Enable gradient checkpointing, reduce batch size
**Poor Quality**: Increase training steps, improve dataset quality
**Dataset Errors**: Verify folder structure and file permissions

### Application Issues

**Model Loading**: Check model files and directory structure
**Generation Fails**: Verify GPU availability and dependencies
**Poor Results**: Adjust generation parameters and prompt specificity
